My name is Heidi Perrett. 
I work for eResearch Services Support at Griffith University as a Senior Software Engineer.
I am responsible for providing support to the clients and product owners of our applications and services
as well as maintaining the applications and services and working on improving our workflow processes.
I attended a few Software Carpentry courses as a helper this year (2015) at the University of Queensland.
