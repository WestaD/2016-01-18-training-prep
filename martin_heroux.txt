Bonjour! 
My name is Martin HÃ©roux. 
I am a physiotherapist by training, but now work as a neuroscientist (sounds fancy!).
My area of expertise is human sensory and motor physiology.
I am a self-taught coder, so I have lots of bad habits to undo and many good habits to learn.
I hope that my own experience learning to code and work with data can help others discover better ways to do research.
